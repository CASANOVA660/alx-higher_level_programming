# Python Exceptions Mini-Projects

Welcome to the Python Exceptions Mini-Projects repository! This collection of small Python scripts is dedicated to exploring various aspects of exception handling in Python.

## Overview

This repository contains a series of Python scripts, each representing a mini-project focused on a specific aspect of exception handling. These mini-projects are designed to be concise and focused, allowing you to dive deep into different scenarios where exceptions play a crucial role in Python programming.

## Mini-Projects

Here's a brief overview of each mini-project included in this repository:

### 1. `0-safe_print_list.py`

This script demonstrates safe printing of elements in a list, handling any potential exceptions that may occur during the printing process.

### 2. `1-safe_print_integer.py`

In this script, you'll explore safe printing of integers, ensuring that only valid integers are printed without raising any exceptions.

### 3. `2-safe_print_list_integers.py`

This script extends the previous example by printing only the integers from a given list, handling exceptions gracefully for non-integer elements.

### 4. `3-safe_print_division.py`

Here, you'll learn how to safely perform division operations in Python, handling exceptions such as division by zero without crashing the program.

### 5. `4-list_division.py`

This script demonstrates dividing corresponding elements of two lists, handling potential exceptions like zero division and index errors.

### 6. `5-raise_exception.py`

In this script, you'll see how to raise an exception manually in Python, showcasing the `raise` keyword and its usage.

### 7. `6-raise_exception_msg.py`

This script extends the previous example by raising a custom exception with a specified error message, providing more context for the raised exception.

## Usage

Each mini-project is contained within its own Python file. To explore a specific aspect of exception handling, simply open the corresponding Python file and follow the instructions provided in the comments.
