# Python - Classes and Objects

Welcome to the Python - Classes and Objects mini project repository! This project explores the fundamentals of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python, focusing on classes, objects, attributes, and methods. Through a series of Python files, various concepts and practices related to OOP in Python are demonstrated.

## Overview

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects, which can contain data (attributes) and behaviors (methods). Python, being an object-oriented language, supports OOP principles extensively.

This project serves as an educational resource for individuals looking to understand OOP concepts in Python. By studying and experimenting with the provided Python files, you'll gain insights into how to design and implement classes, work with objects and their attributes, and utilize OOP principles effectively.

## Files

The project consists of the following Python files:

- `0-square.py`: My first square
- `1-square.py`: Square with size
- `2-square.py`: Size validation
- `3-square.py`: Area of a square
- `4-square.py`: Access and update private attribute
- `5-square.py`: Printing a square
- `6-square.py`: Coordinates of a square

Each file focuses on specific aspects of OOP in Python, building upon the concepts introduced in the previous ones. By studying these files sequentially, you'll develop a comprehensive understanding of OOP principles and their implementation in Python.

## Concepts Applied

Throughout the project, various OOP concepts are applied, including:

- Class definition and instantiation
- Attribute manipulation (public, protected, private)
- Method definition and usage
- Initialization method (`__init__`)
- Encapsulation (data abstraction, information hiding)
- Property creation and usage
- Getter and setter methods
- Dynamic attribute creation
- Binding attributes to objects and classes
- Understanding `self` in Python
- Exploring the `__dict__` attribute
- Attribute access with `getattr` function

## How to Use

To get started with this project, you can clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CASANOVA666/python-classes-and-objects.git



After cloning the repository, you can explore the Python files using any text editor or Python IDE of your choice. Feel free to modify and experiment with the code to deepen your understanding of OOP concepts in Python.
